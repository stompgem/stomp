===Hash Login Example Usage (this is the recommended login technique)

  hash = {
      :hosts => [
        # First connect is to remotehost1
        {:login => "login1", :passcode => "passcode1", :host => "remotehost1", :port => 61612, :ssl => true},
        # First failover connect is to remotehost2
        {:login => "login2", :passcode => "passcode2", :host => "remotehost2", :port => 61613, :ssl => false},

      ],
      # These are the default parameters and do not need to be set
      :reliable => true,                  # reliable (use failover)
      :initial_reconnect_delay => 0.01,   # initial delay before reconnect (secs)
      :max_reconnect_delay => 30.0,       # max delay before reconnect
      :use_exponential_back_off => true,  # increase delay between reconnect attpempts
      :back_off_multiplier => 2,          # next delay multiplier
      :max_reconnect_attempts => 0,       # retry forever, use # for maximum attempts
      :randomize => false,                # do not radomize hosts hash before reconnect
      :connect_timeout => 0,              # Timeout for TCP/TLS connects, use # for max seconds
      :connect_headers => {},             # user supplied CONNECT headers (req'd for Stomp 1.1+)
      :parse_timeout => 5,                # receive / read timeout, secs
      :logger => nil,                     # user suplied callback logger instance
      :dmh => false,                      # do not support multihomed IPV4 / IPV6 hosts during failover
      :closed_check => true,              # check first if closed in each protocol method
      :hbser => false,                    # raise on heartbeat send exception
      :stompconn => false,                # Use STOMP instead of CONNECT
      :usecrlf => false,                  # Use CRLF command and header line ends (1.2+)
    }

    # for client
    client = Stomp::Client.new(hash)

    # for connection
    connection = Stomp::Connection.new(hash)

===Positional Parameter Usage

    client = Stomp::Client.new("user", "pass", "localhost", 61613)
    client.publish("/queue/mine", "hello world!")
    client.subscribe("/queue/mine") do |msg|
      p msg
    end

===Stomp URL Usage

    # Stomp URL :
    A Stomp URL must begin with 'stomp://' and can be in one of the following forms:

    stomp://host:port
    stomp://host.domain.tld:port
    stomp://login:passcode@host:port
    stomp://login:passcode@host.domain.tld:port

    e.g. c = Stomp::Client.new(urlstring)

===Failover + SSL Example URL Usage

    options = "initialReconnectDelay=5000&randomize=false&useExponentialBackOff=false"

    # remotehost1 uses SSL, remotehost2 doesn't
    client = Stomp::Client.new("failover:(stomp+ssl://login1:passcode1@remotehost1:61612,stomp://login2:passcode2@remotehost2:61613)?#{options}")

    client.publish("/queue/mine", "hello world!")
    client.subscribe("/queue/mine") do |msg|
      p msg
    end
